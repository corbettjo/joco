                <br/> I'm Jon, a Boston-based designer and developer with a soft spot for beautiful logos, well-documented code, and golden retreivers.

                <br/> I'm a Texan at heart, but am currently braving the elements at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer Science and Graphic Design. I love exploring the interseciton of creativity and technology, and using design thinking to solve challenging problems.
